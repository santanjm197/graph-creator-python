# graph-creator-python
An interactive program that allows the user to create and manipulate graphs.  The project was initially
inspired by the YouTube video "The Dollar Game" from the mathematics channel Numberphile:

The program allows the user to construct freeform undirected graphs and then manipulate them in various ways,
most notably by 'giving' and 'taking' between adjacent vertices as is shown in the video.  It also allows the
user to calculate the shortest path between vertices in graph using Dijkstra's Shortest Path Algorithm, see:

I coded the project using Python 3.6 and made heavy use of the tkinter module, see:

I also coded the project using the PyCharm IDE on Windows 10

TO RUN: Make sure all of the files are in the same folder and then run Main.py.  Then follow the instructions
shown in the program.  To start creating a graph, click the New Vertex button and then click anywhere in the gray
canvas to place a vertex.
